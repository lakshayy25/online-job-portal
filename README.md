# Online Job Portal

A full-stack web application that connects job seekers and recruiters on a single platform.  
Users can browse and apply for jobs, while recruiters can post and manage job listings.

This project was built as part of my full-stack development journey, focusing on clean architecture,

## 🧠 Development Approach

This project was developed using **AI-assisted development tools** (such as GitHub Copilot)
to speed up repetitive tasks like boilerplate generation and refactoring.

All core application logic, system architecture, data flow, and debugging
were designed, implemented, and verified manually to ensure reliability and maintainability.
